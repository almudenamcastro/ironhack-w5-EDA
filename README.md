## Project Overview

[Explor the project presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGSaUBeAss/qLx6aQaJyRyAbJ4eA27iMA/view?utm_content=DAGSaUBeAss&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor)

### Business Problem
Vanguard is a US-based investment management company. As part of the the Customer Experience (CX) team, we have recently launched a digital experiment comparing two different versions of the website. No, we want to uncover the results of the test. 

### Initial Hypotheses:
We believe that the new version of the website helps users complete the process. 
1. **Completion rate**: We believe that more clients will complete the process.
2. **Time spent**: We believe that the time spent on the web will increase.
3. **Error rate**: We believe that the error rate will decrease.

### KPIs: 
To validate this hypothesis we have defined the following Key Performance Indicators: 
- **CR**: Our conversion rate si defined as the % that complete the online process. This metric will be our northstar. 

Other metrics: 
- **Time spent on the web**: Amount of time spent on the website.
- **Avg. visit duration**:
- **Avg. step duration**.
- **Number of visits**: Nr of visits per client. 
- **Error rate**: Nr of times a user has to go back in the process.  
- **Step dropoff**:
- **Step 0 bounce rate**:

## Data Sources: 
The data sources can be found in the folder data/raw
- 'data/df_final demo.txt' Includes website events data. 
- 'data/df_final_experiment_clients.txt' clientd data. 
- 'data/df_final_web_data_pt_1.txt' experiment data. 
- 'data/df_final_web_data_pt_2.txt' experiment data. 

## Methodology

1. **Bussiness problem and hypothesis definition**: Define the business problem and the data we need to test our hypothesis. 
2. **Data Cleaning**: Processing the raw data to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct errors.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the distribution of data, detecting trends, and identifying correlations between variables.
4. **Hypothesis Testing**: Using statistical techniques to test our initial assumptions and draw meaningful conclusions from the data.
5. **Visualization**: Presenting the findings through informative visualizations such as heat maps, bar charts, and geographical maps.
